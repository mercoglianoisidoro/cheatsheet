# DevOps and SRE

## DevOps vs SRE

class SRE implement DevOps

| DevOps                          | SRE                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Reduce silos                    | Share ownership              |
| Leverage tooling and automation | Automate!                    |
| Implement gradual change        | Reduce cost failure          |
| Accept failures as normal       | SLOs and blameless PMs       |
| Measure everything              | Measure toil and reliability |



DevOps: set of practices and culture design to break down barriers between developers, operators and other stakeholders.

SRE: a prescriptive way for implementing DevOps.

## SRE notes from google books

### Definition

SRE naming origins from:

- Site: it was google.com. Today SRE is related to services
- Reliability: reliable enough
- Engineering: computer science and engineering to the design and development of computer systems

### Error budget

A service that is available 99.9%, is unavailable 0.01%.

**The permitted unavailability is the error budget.**

It can be spent to improve the product introducing new features.

### Service Level Terminology

Event without SLA, it's valuable to define SLIs and SLOs.



**SLI - service level indicator:**

a carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided

examples:

- request latency (how long it takes to return a response to a request )
- error rate
- system throughput
- availability:
  - 99.999% referred as 5 nines
  - 99.95 % referred as 3 and a half nines

**SLO - service level objective:**

a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI

example:

- SLI <= target
- lower bound <= SLI <= upper bound



**SLA - service level agreements:**

an explicit or implicit contract with your users that includes consequences of meeting (or missing) the SLOs they contain.

They are closely tied up to business and product decisions.



**Error budget:**

a rate at which the SLOs can be missed



### Toil

It is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scale linearly as a service grows.

(only some of these can be enough to define it)



Toil is defined as opposite to :

#### Engineering work

- requires human judgment
- produce a permanent improvement
- is guided by strategy
- is frequently creative and innovative, taking a design-driven approach to solving a problem



### Monitoring

"Collecting, processing, aggregating, and displaying real-time quantitative data about a system, such as query counts and types, error counts and types, processing times, and server lifetimes".

A monitoring system should address **2 questions**: what's broken, why?

**Minimal metrics** to measure for user-facing systems:

- **latency**: time it takes to service a request (It’s important to distinguish between the latency of successful requests and the latency of failed requests)
- **traffic**: how much demand is being placed on your system, measured in a high-level system-specific metric
- **errors**: rate of requests that fail, either explicitly, implicitly, or by policy
- **saturation**: how “full” your service is



Different aspects of a system should be measured with different levels of granularity.
