# Cloud computing

([from csrc.nist.gov](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final))
is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.


from ISO/IEC:
Paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual
resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand.


## note
The key techniques to create a cloud are abstraction and orchestration: virtualization; lacks the orchestration.
Clouds are multitenant by nature, but segregation and isolation are in place.

## five characteristics

1. On-demand self-service
2. Broad network access
3. Resource pooling
4. Rapid elasticity
5. Measured service

## Service models

- SaaS: Software as a Service
- PaaS: Platform as a Service
- IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service



**Definitions in short, from NIST:**

- SaaS: capability  to use the providerâ€™s applications running on a cloud infrastructure.
- PaaS: capability provided to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure applications, without control of the underlying infrastructure. Otherwise said: abstracts and provides development or application platforms.
- IaaS: capability to provision resource pool of fundamental computing infrastructure.

## Deployment models

- Private cloud: specific to organizations
- Public cloud: available for general public
- Community cloud: specific communities
- Hybrid cloud: in the middle of two or more other models



**Definitions in short, from NIST:**

- Private cloud: exclusive use by a single organization (comprising multiple consumers; e.g., business units).
- Community cloud: provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns
- Public cloud: provisioned for open use by the general public
- Hybrid cloud: composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures

## Cloud Native Computing

Simple definition provided by [microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition):

*Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model.*

From the  [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/):

*Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.*

*These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.*



## Logical Model

from CSA:

- Infrastructure
- Metastructure (it includes the management plane - key difference between the cloud and traditional computing)
- Infostructure
- Applistructure
