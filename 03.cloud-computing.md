# Cloud computing

([from csrc.nist.gov](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final))
is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.


## five characteristics

1. On-demand self-service
2. Broad network access
3. Resource pooling
4. Rapid elasticity
5. Measured service

## three service models

- SaaS: Software as a Service
- PaaS: Platform as a Service
- IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service



## four deployment models

- Private cloud: specific to organizations
- Public cloud: available for general public
- Community cloud: specific communities
- Hybrid cloud: in the middle of two or more other models



## Cloud Native Computing

Simple definition provided by [microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition):

> *Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model.*

From the  [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/):

> *Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.*

> *These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.*
