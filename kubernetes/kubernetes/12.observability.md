# Observability

## Reminder - The components of observability


from [https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/):

**Traces:**
Traces give us the big picture of what happens when a request is made by user or an application.

**Metrics:**
A metric is a measurement about a service, captured at runtime.

**Logs:**
A log is a timestamped text record, either structured (recommended) or unstructured, with metadata.

**Baggage:**
Baggage refers to contextual information thatâ€™s passed between spans



## Logging

Having a logging backend , 3 way of logging:

- **Application forwarding:**
  the app send logs directly to a backend

- **Sidecar processing:**
  a sidecar manage logs.
  The app write to a shared storage (shared between app pod and sidecar); the sidecar read and process the. It can 1) forward, or 2) write to stdout/stderr

- **Node agent forwarding:**
  a pod on each node forward to a backend.

  A log processor runs on each node, read the logfiles and forward to a backend. (The most used)



### Node agent forwarding

The most used node agent is Fluentd and Fluent Bit.
Consider using Fluentd if you need its plug-ins, and use it as an aggregator in the cluster.



### Kubernetes Audit Logs

Useful to answer the question: who did what.

Audit policy are passed to the control plane by the option --audit-policy-file flag.



### Kubernetes Events

Kubernetes Events are a native k8s object: the are a king of platform log stored in etcd with a retention time of 1 hour.

They expose information on event happening inside the cluster.

They are available by API, kubectl or you can export them as metrics (ex: Prometheur exporter).





## Metrics / Prometheus

Prometheus is the open source metrics tool used as standard de facto on k8s.
Reminder: app and infra expose metrics that Prometheus can scrape.

The control plane components expose Prometheus metrics.

### Storage

Prometheus is not designed for long-term storage of metrics but many solution exists: [https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage)

Note: [Thanos](https://thanos.io/) and [Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io/) are 2 projects of CNCF



### Scraping model and Pushgateway

Prometheus is base on a scraping model (metrics are exposed on an endpoint and Prometheus read them).

This is not a good fit for every workload: in this case use [Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway): metrics are pushed to pushgteway and it expose them.



### Metrics

**Client libraries** for exposing metrics: [https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/)

**Exporters** let to export metrics to Prometheus: [https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/#third-party-exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/#third-party-exporters)



### Federation

(Federation refers to consolidating data and control into a centralized system).

Prometheus federation let to collect from various Prometheus to centralize data into a central  Prometheus server: this is supported by Prometheus that can scrape from others Prometheus.

This can be complex to manage: Thanos offers similar capabilities.



### Alerts

When an alert is triggered, the alert is sent to a configured Alertmanager instance.



## Prometheus Operator

Prometheus Operator: https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator

### Install by using the community helm chart

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

helm repo update

helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

This install:

- Prometheus Operator
- Prometheus and Alertmanager (creates the Prometheus, Alertmanager and related CRs)
  Grafana
- some exporteds, like node-exporter

They are configured to work together.



### Tip

to get the helm values:

```bash
helm show values prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

to install in a namespace settint values:

```bash
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n default  -f prometheus_values.yaml
```



### Design

- |        CRD         |                          defines a                           | some details                                                 |
  | :----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  |     Prometheus     |                       Prometheus setup                       | it provides options to configure replication, persistent storage and the Alertmanagers to use |
  |    Alertmanager    |                      alertmanager setup                      | Let to: decouple alert, silence alerts, route and send grouped notification via providers |
  |   ServiceMonitor   |         dynamic set of services should be monitored          | label selections is used. Each one is converted to a scrape config |
  |     PodMonitor     |          a dynamic set of pods should be monitored           | let to monitor on pods even without a service                |
  |       Probe        | define how groups of ingresses and static targets should be monitored |                                                              |
  |   PrometheusRule   | a desired Prometheus rule to be consumed by one or more Prometheus instances | Alerts and recording rules can be saved and applied as YAML files, and dynamically loaded without requiring any restart |
  | AlertmanagerConfig | subsections of the Alertmanager configuration, allowing routing of alerts to custom receivers, and setting inhibit rules |                                                              |




### Targets to scrape

In Prometheus, targets to scrape can be set in two ways:

- static configuration: using static_configs. [See example.](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/release-2.29/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml)
- service discovery: many service discovery mechanism are supported (DNS, AWS, Consul, ...) For K8s the k8s API are used. [See example.](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/release-2.29/documentation/examples/prometheus-kubernetes.yml)

With the operator this is made by the ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor

### Rules

In Prometheus the rules ( configured and evaluated at regular intervals), are of 2 types:

- Recording rules: allow pre-compute PromQL expressions (to be reused quickly)
- Alerting rules: allow todefine alert conditions

When using Prometheus Operator they are set by the PrometheusRule.
