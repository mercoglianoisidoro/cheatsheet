# Architecture and Architecture Style


## Software Architecture

From wikipedia:
*Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations*

From Len Bass:
*The software architecture of a computing system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both*

From "Microservices Patterns", By Chris Richardson:
*The architecture of a software application is its high-level structure, which consists of constituent parts and the dependencies between those parts*

=> architecture = decomposition into parts (elements of the system) and their relationships (relations between elements).

### Note
The chosen architecture will determine technical requirements.


## Architecture Style

From David Garlan and Mary Shaw, https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/able/ftp/intro_softarch/intro_softarch.pdf:

An architectural style ... defines a family of ... systems in terms of a pattern of structural organization. More specifically, *an architectural style determines the vocabulary of components and connectors that can be used in instances of that style, together with a set of constraints on how they can be combined*.

=> it defines a limited palette of elements (components) and relations (connectors) to use in your architecture.
